# Referral Program

Our Referral Program allows you to earn the real money, that can be spent on buying the Quantower licenses or even be withdrawn on demand. The earning process is simple: you receive **20% from each purchase** sum of your referral. We can increase % depends on our own view!

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your referral \(the person you invited\) must **register an account** in our license system **Through Your Link!** Otherwise, he will not be counted as your referral.
{% endhint %}
