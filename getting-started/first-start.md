During the first start of Quantower terminal you will get several elements of the platform, automatically created for testing purposes: 

* \*\*\*\*[**Workspace**](https://help.quantower.com/getting-started/workspaces-binds-groups#workspaces)  ****
* **"**[**Bind**](https://help.quantower.com/getting-started/workspaces-binds-groups#binds)**"** with several most popular trading panels
* An active **connection to Binance with Info Mode**

![Default Workspace with merged panels in Bind](../.gitbook/assets/default-workspace.png)

From this point, you can start using Quantower. Customize the workspace, open new panels. For sending trading orders you need to switch to other trading connections like [**CQG**](../connections/connection-to-cqg-amp-futures/)**,** [**Rithmic**](../connections/connection-to-rithmic.md)**,** [**cTrader**](../connections/connection-to-ctrader/)**,** [**Interactive Brokers**](../connections/connect-quantower-to-interactive-broker.md).
