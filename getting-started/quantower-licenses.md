# Quantower Licenses

We deliver the most popular trading and analytics functionality for free, but some valuable and market-specific features are available under the paid License.

{% hint style="info" %}
In case of any problems with your Quantower Account or License purchase — please [contact our Support team](https://www.quantower.com/contact-us)
{% endhint %}

To use any paid License, the trader needs to have an active [Quantower Account](quantower-account.md). If you don’t have one, you can create it during your License purchase process.
