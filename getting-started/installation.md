# Installation

Once you downloaded Quantower application from Quantower official website — you are ready to start an installation process. From this point we must clarify the main differences between Quantower "installation process" and default Windows® install process, that most users are accustomed to.

{% hint style="success" %}
Quantower does not copy its files to the system folders \(AppData or Program Files\) of the OS, nor does write changes to the system registry
{% endhint %}

What does it mean? The program doesn't violate the integrity of the OS, and in case of removal, it will not leave any prints of its presence on your computer. Quantower’s "installer" literally extracts files to the user-specified folder.

This approach allows you to store \(and launch\) the Quantower on removable drive for use on any other computer as the portable application. It can be convenient when you need to move Quantower with all of its settings to another PC; just copy Quantower folder and paste where you need.

### PC requirements

{% hint style="info" %}
* Windows 10
* [.NET Framework v.4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer)
* Available disk space — 1 GB \(depends on the volume of loaded history\)
* **The hardware requirements for Quantower depends upon what you are doing with it.** Most desktop systems can run Quantower without any difficulty. 
* The following hardware specifications, are very much recommended for a fast system: 16 GB RAM, minimum of 4 core CPU, and a SSD \(solid-state drive\).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Microsoft has officially stopped supporting Windows 8 and Windows 7**. Therefore, the platform may not start or may work incorrectly. [More information on supported versions, please check on official Microsoft website.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet)  
  
We recommend using Windows 10.

{% endhint %}

### Uninstall

If you need to uninstall the application, just _**delete the folder with all application files**_. You may also keep your personal settings \(connection information & workspaces\) by copying the Settings folder \(can be found right in Quantower folder\) before application delete. These Settings folder can be pasted to any other Quantower folder later.

You may also refer to [**Backup & Restore manager**](backup-and-restore-manager.md) to backup your settings in one file and restore them later.
