# Introduction

## General idea

**Quantower** trading platform provides a wide set of professional features for manual trading, but you can use it for algorithmic trading also. With Quantower Algo solutions you can simply create standard trading scripts such as indicators and strategies, as well as additional platform extensions: own connectors with brokers, plugins, Custom columns, etc. What is differ Quantower, from other trading platforms - you don't need to study some proprietary language or development environment. You will use the only standard, well-known instruments, that used by developers all over the world. 

There are three main key points in our vision of algorithmic scripts development:

* C\# programming language
* Integration with major Development Environments: Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Atom, etc.
* Open and transparent API

### C\# programming language

C\# is simple, powerful, flexible and it is one of the most popular programming languages in The World. It means a large community and great support, many ready-to-use components and a lot of tutorials, video lessons in any language, and for any level of development skills - from starter to professional. In addition, most modern trading platforms support coding in C\#. It became a kind of standard in the trading industry, so you can be sure - you will always be able to use your knowledge later and not waste your time studying it.

### Integration with major Development Environments

We are planning to provide our users the possibility to use all well-known products via special extensions or plugins. At the moment we have an integration between Quantower trading platform and Visual Studio â€” just in a few clicks, you can create your indicator and see it directly on the chart panel. All professional features from Visual Studio are available for you out of the box: a code editor with IntelliSense, advanced debugger, support for source control systems, and many others. You can use the special Community version of Visual Studio which is free for private usage.

### Open and transparent API

We provide absolutely full access to all functionality of our trading core layer for developers. Moreover, we are developing Quantower using the same API, which means you always will have an up-to-date and powerful set of features, which allows you to create a script at any level script, from trivial indicators to complex strategies or trading/analytics panels.
