# Templates

Due to the wide list of features, most panels in Quantower platform have a huge list of customization possibilities. The more powerful panel is — the more settings it has. This allows any user to tune each functionality on its own and sometimes this process can take a lot of time to complete.

In order to save your work on workspace customization, we have developed a _**“Templates”**_ functionality. It helps you to save your customizations in special objects — templates — and instantiate them later, keeping all of the applied settings.

You can _**save any**_ [_**Panel**_](standalone-panels.md)_**,**_ [_**Group**_](group-of-panels.md) _**or**_ [_**Bind**_](binds.md) _**as a template**_, so its usefulness is very promising.

### How to create the template?

The process of Template creation is as simple as 1-2-3: 

1. Open any panel \(or use Group / Bind\)
2. Customize it according to your needs
3. Save as Template with a custom name.

![&#x201C;Save as template&#x201D; option in panel&#x2019;s context menu](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28135%29.png)

All of the created templates are stored in Control center sidebar, under the _**“Templates”**_ group. So you can launch any template from this place any time you wish. You can put the saved templates on the Favorites bar of Control center, like any other default panel.

**Apply template.** Once you created several templates you can apply any of them to this particular panel.

If you want to **edit** the template name or **delete** it from your terminal — use the context menu on it. Each Template stores all of the settings data, including sizes, coloring, internal elements visibility, a predefined symbol of account values, additional specific settings etc. In other words: all that you can customize + more.

If the separate panel is in the Bind, the template saving cannot be applied to it. In this case, **the template can be saved only for Bind.**

You can **share your templates** with other Quantower traders by sharing the template files with them. Template files can be found in “Quantower -&gt; Settings -&gt; Templates” folder.
