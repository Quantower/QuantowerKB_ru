**Alert** on the financial market is a standard signal that notifies you when the price reaches a certain level on the chart, pre-set in the settings. A notification comes in the form of: sound, a notification opened on the monitor, a [telegram](../miscellaneous-panels/quantower-telegram-bot.md) email sent instantly as soon as the price has approached a specific value.
