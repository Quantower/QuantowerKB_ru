To get started, you need to specify which symbols or markets you are going to work with. You can choose a single symbol or all of the symbols at a given broker. I chose a few symbols at random to show you how it works.

You can change the Quantower heat map display. Setup - Threemap shows the fastest symbols with the largest size. The Sells setting sorts the symbols from largest to smallest value
