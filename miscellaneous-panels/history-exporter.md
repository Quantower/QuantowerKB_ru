You can start loading only one selected or all symbols at once. The loading process is displayed on the status bar. If the download process takes a lot of time, you can click the **Pause** button to stop the download process. To remove a symbol from the list of tasks, click on the **Trash** icon.

You can also edit the settings for a selected symbol, like the data type or loading range, by clicking on the **Gear** icon.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You will not be able to change the settings of a task if it is already in the process of loading or paused. In this case, it must be removed from the list of tasks and re-add the required symbol with different settings.
{% endhint %}
