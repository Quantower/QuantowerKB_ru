# Crypto balances

{% hint style="info" %}
This panel refers to the Crypto-specific panels, meaning that it can be used when the user has at least one active connection with crypto symbols.
{% endhint %}

Crypto balances panel shows all of your coin balances list. Here you can find info about the amounts per asset: total, available for trading, reserved in opened orders, calculated in BTC, calculated in USD.

There is also an info bar with total amounts of your coins in BTC & USD. By default, we hid assets with zero balances, so the list looks more clear, but you can enable the full list via the panel settings \(“Hide zero balances” option\).
