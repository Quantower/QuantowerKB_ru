## How to add trading symbols from the CQG connection?

By default, we do not provide a predefined list of symbols (maybe in the next updates we will add default symbols). To find the desired symbol, go to the [**Tradable Symbols**](https://www.cqg.com/partners/exchanges/tradable-symbols) page on the CQG site where you can find a correct ticker. Also, we’ve prepared a list of the most frequent trading symbols for the futures market.
