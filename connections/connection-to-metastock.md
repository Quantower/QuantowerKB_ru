Metastock offers a database of various analytical data that is divided not only by type, but also by region. For example, if you need market data for a specific exchange, or a region \(Asia, Europe\), you can easily select it on their website. But we recommend using Metastock support for that, which will help you to create the data plan that will fit your requirements.
