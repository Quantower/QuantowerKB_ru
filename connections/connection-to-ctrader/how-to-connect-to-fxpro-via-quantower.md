* Go to the official FxPro website, and in the [**Tools** section](https://www.fxpro.com/trading-platforms/ctrader) select the cTrader platform
* **Create a trading account** by filling out the registration form. Demo and Real account are created under one cTrader ID, therefore there is only one form for opening an account. During the registration, always choose the **cTrader** platform where you need to specify it.
