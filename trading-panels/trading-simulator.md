## What is Trading Simulator?

Trading Simulator is a specially designed trading tool that allows emulating the execution of orders for any connection, including those that do not allow trading.

For whom it will be useful? For any trader - from beginner to pros, trading in with any type of instrument. For example, crypto traders who do not have real accounts on a crypto exchange can trade in the demo mode on the selected crypto exchange.

* **Initial balance** — the amount of money for the test account.

{% hint style="info" %}
Trading Simulator creates separate trading accounts for each base currency of the instrument. For example, if you chose EUR / USD currency pair, then the account name will be **Account \(USD\)**, if you select EUR / JPY, then the name will be **Account \(JPY\)** respectively.
{% endhint %}

* **Execution Delay** — the length of time between the acceptance of an order and its execution. In the real market, this parameter affects on the slippage.  There are 3 options for the delay: _Range_, _Fix_ and _None_ \(instant execution\).

Examples of using each method you can find in the description of the [History Player panel settings](https://help.quantower.com/trading-panels/history-player#general-and-instruments-settings).
