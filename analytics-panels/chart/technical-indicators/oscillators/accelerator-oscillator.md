## Formula

MEDIAN PRICE = \(HIGH + LOW\) / 2  
AO = SMA \(MEDIAN PRICE, 5\) - SMA \(MEDIAN PRICE, 34\)  
AC = AO - SMA \(AO, 5\)  


Where:  
MEDIAN PRICE — median price;  
HIGH — the highest price of the bar;  
LOW — the lowest price of the bar;  
SMA — Simple Moving Average;  
AO — Awesome Oscillator.



## Most useful cases

* **Divergence/Convergence** - Divergence/Convergence pattern is a form of price action when new high\(low\) of the price not confirmed with a new high/low of  AC. Such price and indicator’s behavior can be interpreted as the weakness of current existing trend.
