# Tick chart

Tick ​​Chart builds a new bar after a set number of trades, for example after every 610 trades. Basic charts \(like time-based\) draw a new bar after a set period of time, for example after every 5 minutes or hours.

For example, each bar of a 610 tick chart represents 610 trades of any size. A tick can be a trade of just one contract, or 10,000 contracts. This is why it’s crucial to combine the use of tick charts with volume.
