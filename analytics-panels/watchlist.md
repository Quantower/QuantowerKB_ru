Each symbol added to watchlist can be removed via the context menu on the symbol’s row. You can also clear all list via the context menu.

When you add a symbol, that is already presented in current list, it will be added to the end of the list thus making a duplicates.

## Columns management

## Favorite lists

You may want to have a possibility to save several lists for Watchlist panel. To save some list as Favorite, you can use the **\[ Saved lists \]** button on the toolbar. If you have no saved lists yet, it will open a **“Save current list”** popup, where you can set the name for the list, that you are saving.

Using the _**“Favorite lists”**_ drop-down, you can manage the current saved lists \(edit name, remove\) and initiate the current list save.

![There are two ways to add indicators in the panel](../.gitbook/assets/indicators-watchlist-second-way.png)

When you select an indicator, you will see the new column \(with the selected indicator name\) added to the right side of watchlist table. To remove indicator, go to the Indicators category in the context menu and click the _**“Remove Indicator Name”**_ option.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some indicators need time to calculate their values. You will see the “Initializing...” text in such cells.
{% endhint %}

If you have created \(or added\) a custom indicator in the platform and want to add it to the Watchlist panel, you need to add an additional parameter to the code. More information about how to do this is given in our guide "[**Adding a custom indicator to Watchlist**](../quantower-algo/custom-indicator-to-watchlist.md)".
